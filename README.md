DMP 4: Organization, Backup and storage

The data, notes, and versions of papers for my research project are stored on GDrive with my University Onid account. I have identified strategies to organizing my data and all the versions by choosing consistent naming formats and putting the dates of last modification at the end of the file name. Also, learned during Charlotte Wickham’s talk the importance of putting only one value per cell.
The data will be retained on GDrive until I complete my thesis, when it will be transferred to OSU’s ScholarsArchive. 

The data is stored securely in organized folders/categories in GDrive temporarily until the research project is complete.  Upon submitting the final thesis with OSU ScholarsArchive given their criteria, format, and naming conventions ie; LastnameFirstnameMiddleinitialGraduationyear.pdf (ScholarsArchive, 2019) will then be responsible for the security, access and longterm storage of the data. 

My data consists of photos, pdfs of articles related to my thesis topic, working versions of my thesis in MS Word format, related self-authored drafts and pdfs of submitted papers, and Excel spreadsheets. 
Currently, I have at least three versions of papers and several versions of notes all stored on GDrive cloud, with periodic backups a CD or flash drive.

How will you automate the process? Google Drive has Backup & Sync functionality to link GDrive to the local laptop.  When I looked in the help pages on how to restore lost data, it recognized my ONID account and said to contact the OSU administrator. 
As far as other backup programs, I might consider using Box for storage. 

I don’t currently work on a team project with shared files. As a Botany Curation Assistant at the Herbarium, I was given a copy of the data I needed to use in an Excel spreadsheet. Furthermore, I am not currently editing this copy, only using it to look up plant voucher specimens. Next term I will being editing the data base, so I will have to see what the procedures are for that.
