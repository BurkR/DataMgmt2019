DMP 4: Organization, Backup and storage
Due Monday by 9am  Points 10 Submitting a text entry box Available Feb 19 at 11am - Mar 31 at 11:59pm about 1 month
Learning goals: the goals of this homework are to demonstrate that the student can

identify specific strategies to ensure that their data will stay organized (including organization of different versions). 
identify where to store their data to ensure that the datasets will be secure and only accessed by people with authorized access.
plan how long the data will be retained, according to OSU policy.
design a backup strategy that will ensure that data is secure from technological failure and human errors. 
Type of assignment: writing assignment. 

Length: The general guideline is minimum 150 words, maximum ~700 words (~1/2 to ~1 page if you use, for example, Arial, size 12).

Format:  Please upload your document through Canvas. You can upload your document in an open format, or in word. 

Questions to answer:

1.Go to your GitHub DMP and fill up the 3 first sections (data description, roles and responsibilities, data storage and metadata) as best as you can. Use your past homework assignments if you want. Please review my comments to your homework assignments and improve your answers, if needed.

2. Describe where the data will be stored during the project, and for how long it will be retained. Do this in the 4th section of your GitHub DMP (storage and security)

3. Describe the backup strategy that you will follow for your datasets and other research materials in your project. Do this in the 4th section of your GitHub DMP (storage and security). How many copies, in total, will you have? How will you automate the process? Which programs will you use? If you use a shared network drive, how is it backed up? If you are going to use a cloud system, will you take any precautions to ensure that data will not be lost when you graduate?

If there is any information that you think is crucial for a DMP, that you do not want to put in a public repository, send me a note. 

Handing the assignment: send me again the url of your GitHub repository once you are ready for me to grade (not the rendered website, but the repository. It should look like https://github.com/clarallebot/GRAD521_DMPLLebot_2019 (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. )
